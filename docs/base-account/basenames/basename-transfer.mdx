# Basename Transfer Guide (2026)

## Transfer Your Basename to a New Wallet

This guide walks you through transferring your Basename to a new wallet address. Whether you're upgrading to a smart wallet, consolidating addresses, or moving to a new device, this process ensures your Basename moves with you securely.

### Prerequisites

Before starting your transfer:

✅ **Access to your current wallet** - The wallet that currently owns the Basename  
✅ **Your new wallet address** - The destination address (we've copied it to your clipboard)  
✅ **Sufficient ETH for gas** - Small amount of ETH on Base (~$0.50 total for all transactions)  
✅ **10 minutes** - Time needed to complete all steps

<Info>
  **New Wallet Address Ready**: Your new wallet address has been automatically copied to your clipboard. You'll paste this address when prompted during the transfer.
</Info>

### Important Transfer Requirements

<Warning>
  **Always use the official Basenames UI** at [base.org/names](https://base.org/names) for transfers.

Transferring on third-party platforms like OpenSea or other NFT marketplaces will **only** transfer the NFT token itself, not the name resolution or management rights. This will break your Basename functionality.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Smart Wallet Compatibility**: As of 2026, Basenames fully support smart wallets (ERC-4337). You can transfer to Coinbase Smart Wallet, Safe, or any ERC-4337 compatible wallet.
