# Basename Transfer Guide (2026)

## Transfer Your Basename to a New Wallet

This guide walks you through transferring your Basename to a new wallet address. Whether you're upgrading to a smart wallet, consolidating addresses, or moving to a new device, this process ensures your Basename moves with you securely.

### Prerequisites

Before starting your transfer:

✅ **Access to your current wallet** - The wallet that currently owns the Basename  
✅ **Your new wallet address** - The destination address (we've copied it to your clipboard)  
✅ **Sufficient ETH for gas** - Small amount of ETH on Base (~$0.50 total for all transactions)  
✅ **10 minutes** - Time needed to complete all steps

<Info>
  **New Wallet Address Ready**: Your new wallet address has been automatically copied to your clipboard. You'll paste this address when prompted during the transfer.
</Info>

### Important Transfer Requirements

<Warning>
  **Always use the official Basenames UI** at [base.org/names](https://base.org/names) for transfers.

Transferring on third-party platforms like OpenSea or other NFT marketplaces will **only** transfer the NFT token itself, not the name resolution or management rights. This will break your Basename functionality.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Smart Wallet Compatibility**: As of 2026, Basenames fully support smart wallets (ERC-4337). You can transfer to Coinbase Smart Wallet, Safe, or any ERC-4337 compatible wallet.
</Info>

## Transfer Process

### Step 1: Connect Your Current Wallet

1. Visit [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right
3. Select and connect the wallet that **currently owns** your Basename
4. Ensure you're on the **Base network** (not Ethereum mainnet or another chain)

### Step 2: Access Your Basenames

1. Click your wallet address or **"My Basenames"** in the navigation
2. You'll see a list of all Basenames you currently own
3. Locate the Basename you want to transfer

<Info>
  **Multiple Basenames**: If you own multiple Basenames, you can transfer them individually or in batch. We'll cover batch transfers at the end of this guide.
</Info>

### Step 3: Initiate the Transfer

1. Click the **three dots (⋮)** or **"Manage"** button next to your Basename
2. Select **"Transfer Basename"** from the dropdown menu
3. A transfer modal will appear with important information—read it carefully

### Step 4: Enter Destination Address

1. In the **"Transfer to"** field, paste your new wallet address
   - Use **Ctrl+V** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+V** (Mac)
   - The address should already be on your clipboard
2. **Verify the address carefully** - transfers are irreversible
3. The UI will validate the address format automatically

The 2026 Basename transfer system uses an **optimized three-transaction bundle**:

<Warning>
  **Double-check the address**: ENS names and Basenames are accepted, but we recommend using the full address (0x...) to avoid errors. Transfers cannot be reversed.
</Warning>

### Step 5: Complete the Transfer Bundle

#### Transaction 1: Transfer Name Token
- **What it does**: Transfers the ERC-721 NFT representing your Basename
- **Gas cost**: ~$0.15
- **Status**: Sign and wait for confirmation

#### Transaction 2: Update Address Resolution
- **What it does**: Points your Basename to resolve to the new wallet address
- **Gas cost**: ~$0.15  
- **Status**: Sign and wait for confirmation

#### Transaction 3: Transfer Management Rights
- **What it does**: Grants full management permissions to the new wallet
- **Gas cost**: ~$0.20
- **Status**: Sign and wait for confirmation

<Info>
  **Optimized in 2026**: Previous versions required four separate transactions. The current system bundles ownership and management for better efficiency and lower costs.
</Info>

**Important**: You must complete **all three transactions** in sequence. If you skip any transaction, your Basename will be in an incomplete state.

### Step 6: Verify Transfer Completion

After signing all transactions:
1. Wait for all confirmations (usually 2-6 seconds per transaction)
2. You'll see a success message: **"Transfer Complete ✓"**
3. Your Basename will disappear from your current wallet's list
4. Check [basescan.org](https://basescan.org) to verify the transfer on-chain

## Activating Your Basename on the New Wallet

Once the transfer is complete, activate your Basename on your new wallet:

### Step 1: Switch Wallets

1. Disconnect your current wallet from base.org/names
2. Connect your **new wallet** (the one you transferred to)
3. Ensure you're still on the Base network

### Step 2: Set as Primary Name
1. Navigate to [base.org/names](https://base.org/names) or click **"My Basenames"**
2. Find your transferred Basename in the list
3. Click the **three dots (⋮)** and select **"Set as Primary Name"**
4. Sign the transaction to activate it

<Info>
  **Why set as primary?**: Setting your Basename as primary enables it to appear across Base apps, resolve your address in transactions, and display in social features. This step is required for your Basename to function properly.
</Info>

### Step 3: Update Your Profile (Optional)

After setting your primary name, you can update your profile:

- **Avatar**: Upload a new profile picture or use an NFT
- **Description**: Add a bio or tagline
- **Social Links**: Connect Twitter, GitHub, Discord, etc.
- **Records**: Add custom text records or addresses

## What Gets Transferred?

When you complete the full transfer bundle, ownership of these components moves to your new wallet:

| Component | Description | Transaction |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **NFT Ownership** | The ERC-721 token representing your Basename | Transaction 1 |
| **Name Resolution** | Your Basename points to the new wallet address | Transaction 2 |
| **Management Rights** | Full control to update records and settings | Transaction 3 |
| **Profile Data** | Avatar, bio, social links, and custom records | Automatic |
| **Primary Name Status** | Must be re-set manually after transfer | Manual (Step 6) |

<Warning>
  **Subnames**: If your Basename has subnames (e.g., `wallet.yourname.base.eth`), those remain under your control unless separately transferred. Subname management rights transfer with the parent name.
</Warning>

## Advanced Transfer Options

### Batch Transfer (Multiple Basenames)

If you own multiple Basenames and want to transfer them all:

1. Go to [base.org/names/batch-transfer](https://base.org/names/batch-transfer)
2. Select the Basenames you want to transfer
3. Enter your destination address once
4. Sign a single batch transaction (saves gas fees)

### Transfer with Custom Records

To transfer a Basename while preserving custom records:

1. Before initiating transfer, export your records at [base.org/names/export](https://base.org/names/export)
2. Complete the standard transfer process
3. After activation on new wallet, import your saved records

### Transfer to Smart Contract

<Warning>
  **Smart Contract Transfers**: Only transfer Basenames to smart contracts (multisigs, DAOs, vaults) if you're certain the contract can manage ERC-721 tokens and sign transactions. Lost access cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

If transferring to a smart contract:
- Ensure the contract implements ERC-721 receiver
- Verify you have the necessary signatures/permissions to interact with it
- Test with a less valuable name first if possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Transaction Failed"**
- Ensure you have enough ETH for gas fees (~$0.50 total)
- Check that you're on the Base network, not Ethereum mainnet
- Try increasing gas limit by 20% in wallet settings

**"Invalid Address"**
- Verify the destination address is correct (starts with 0x, 42 characters)
- Basenames and ENS names are supported but use full address for safety
- Ensure you're not using an exchange deposit address

**"Transfer Incomplete"**
- You must complete all three transactions in sequence
- If interrupted, restart from [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
- Check transaction history on Basescan to see which steps completed

**"Name Not Appearing in New Wallet"**
- Wait 1-2 minutes for blockchain confirmations
- Refresh the page and reconnect wallet
- Clear cache or try an incognito window
- Remember to set it as primary after transfer

### Transaction Stuck or Pending

If a transaction is stuck:

1. Check [basescan.org](https://basescan.org) for transaction status
2. If pending for >5 minutes, try speeding it up in your wallet
3. Contact [Base Support](https://base.org/support) if issues persist

### Lost Access to Old Wallet

<Warning>
  **Cannot Transfer Without Access**: You must have access to your current wallet to sign the transfer transactions. If you've lost access to the wallet that owns your Basename, recovery is not possible through the transfer process.
</Warning>

If you've lost access to your old wallet:
- Check if you have backup seed phrases or private keys
- Contact your wallet provider's recovery support
- For Coinbase Wallet, visit [help.coinbase.com](https://help.coinbase.com)

## Security Best Practices

### Before Transferring

✅ Verify destination address multiple times  
✅ Test with a less valuable Basename first (if you own multiple)  
✅ Ensure new wallet is secure and backed up  
✅ Never share your seed phrase or private keys  
✅ Use hardware wallets for high-value Basenames
