# Basename Transfer Guide (2026)

## Transfer Your Basename to a New Wallet

This guide walks you through transferring your Basename to a new wallet address. Whether you're upgrading to a smart wallet, consolidating addresses, or moving to a new device, this process ensures your Basename moves with you securely.

### Prerequisites

Before starting your transfer:

✅ **Access to your current wallet** - The wallet that currently owns the Basename  
✅ **Your new wallet address** - The destination address (we've copied it to your clipboard)  
✅ **Sufficient ETH for gas** - Small amount of ETH on Base (~$0.50 total for all transactions)  
✅ **10 minutes** - Time needed to complete all steps

<Info>
  **New Wallet Address Ready**: Your new wallet address has been automatically copied to your clipboard. You'll paste this address when prompted during the transfer.
</Info>

### Important Transfer Requirements

<Warning>
  **Always use the official Basenames UI** at [base.org/names](https://base.org/names) for transfers.

Transferring on third-party platforms like OpenSea or other NFT marketplaces will **only** transfer the NFT token itself, not the name resolution or management rights. This will break your Basename functionality.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Smart Wallet Compatibility**: As of 2026, Basenames fully support smart wallets (ERC-4337). You can transfer to Coinbase Smart Wallet, Safe, or any ERC-4337 compatible wallet.
</Info>

## Transfer Process

### Step 1: Connect Your Current Wallet

1. Visit [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right
3. Select and connect the wallet that **currently owns** your Basename
4. Ensure you're on the **Base network** (not Ethereum mainnet or another chain)

### Step 2: Access Your Basenames

1. Click your wallet address or **"My Basenames"** in the navigation
2. You'll see a list of all Basenames you currently own
3. Locate the Basename you want to transfer

<Info>
  **Multiple Basenames**: If you own multiple Basenames, you can transfer them individually or in batch. We'll cover batch transfers at the end of this guide.
</Info>

### Step 3: Initiate the Transfer

1. Click the **three dots (⋮)** or **"Manage"** button next to your Basename
2. Select **"Transfer Basename"** from the dropdown menu
3. A transfer modal will appear with important information—read it carefully

### Step 4: Enter Destination Address

1. In the **"Transfer to"** field, paste your new wallet address
   - Use **Ctrl+V** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+V** (Mac)
   - The address should already be on your clipboard
2. **Verify the address carefully** - transfers are irreversible
3. The UI will validate the address format automatically

The 2026 Basename transfer system uses an **optimized three-transaction bundle**:

<Warning>
  **Double-check the address**: ENS names and Basenames are accepted, but we recommend using the full address (0x...) to avoid errors. Transfers cannot be reversed.
</Warning>

### Step 5: Complete the Transfer Bundle

#### Transaction 1: Transfer Name Token
- **What it does**: Transfers the ERC-721 NFT representing your Basename
- **Gas cost**: ~$0.15
- **Status**: Sign and wait for confirmation

#### Transaction 2: Update Address Resolution
- **What it does**: Points your Basename to resolve to the new wallet address
- **Gas cost**: ~$0.15  
- **Status**: Sign and wait for confirmation

#### Transaction 3: Transfer Management Rights
- **What it does**: Grants full management permissions to the new wallet
- **Gas cost**: ~$0.20
- **Status**: Sign and wait for confirmation

<Info>
  **Optimized in 2026**: Previous versions required four separate transactions. The current system bundles ownership and management for better efficiency and lower costs.
</Info>

**Important**: You must complete **all three transactions** in sequence. If you skip any transaction, your Basename will be in an incomplete state.

### Step 6: Verify Transfer Completion

After signing all transactions:
1. Wait for all confirmations (usually 2-6 seconds per transaction)
2. You'll see a success message: **"Transfer Complete ✓"**
3. Your Basename will disappear from your current wallet's list
4. Check [basescan.org](https://basescan.org) to verify the transfer on-chain
