# Build an App on Base - 2026 Guide

Welcome to the updated Base quickstart guide! This walkthrough will help you create a modern onchain application using the latest tools and best practices for 2026.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have created a production-ready onchain application featuring:

- **Modern Development Stack**: Next.js 15 with App Router and OnchainKit v2
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet) and Base Mainnet
- **Gasless Transactions**: Implement sponsored transactions for better UX
- **Onchain Identity**: Integrate Base Names and avatars
- **Account Abstraction**: Support smart wallets alongside EOAs

Our example app will be an onchain counter with a modern, interactive UI that demonstrates core onchain primitives.

## Prerequisites
**Why Base in 2026?**

Base has become the leading L2 for consumer applications, with over 50M+ monthly active addresses. It offers sub-cent transactions, 2-second block times, and seamless integration with Coinbase's 100M+ users. Base is where the onchain economy lives.

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Node.js 20+ installed
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript
- A wallet with Base Sepolia ETH ([get free testnet ETH](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet))

## Set Up Your Development Environment
OnchainKit v2 provides production-ready React components and TypeScript utilities optimized for Base. Let's bootstrap your project:

```bash
npm create onchain@latest
```
During setup, you'll be prompted for:
- **Project name**: Choose your app name
