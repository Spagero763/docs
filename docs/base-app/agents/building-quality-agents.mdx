# UX Guidelines for Base App Agents

*Updated for 2026*

As you start building, review these guidelines to understand what makes an agent successful in the Base app. We recommend trying out existing agents in the app first to get a feel for the quality bar, what works well, and areas for improvement.

## Build a High Quality Foundation

Your agent should provide a seamless, professional experience that users will want to engage with repeatedly. Here are the core requirements:

### Responding to Messages

**Multi-Channel Support**
- Respond to both DMs and group chats appropriately
- Maintain consistent functionality across different conversation types

**Immediate Feedback**
- React to messages with a simple reaction (👀, 👍, ⌛, etc.) to show acknowledgment
- This gives users confidence their message was received while processing

**Fast Response Times**
- Provide responses quickly (< 5 seconds)
- Users expect near-instant communication in messaging apps

### Group Chat Etiquette

In group chats, agents should only respond when:

1. **Mentioned directly** with "@" + agent name (e.g., @bankr)
2. **Replied to directly** when a user replies to the agent's message using the reply content type

This prevents spam and ensures agents participate naturally in group conversations.

### Communication Style
- Use conversational, fun, and clear language
